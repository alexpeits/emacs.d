* keybinding tricks

** vim-like block editing

=C-x SPC= select  =C-t= edit =RET=

** vim-like expansion inside delimiters

- install =expand-region=
- =(global-set-key (kbd "C-=") 'er/expand-region)=
- press repeatedly to expand words, quotes, parens etc

** registers

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
C-x r <SPC> r
    Record the position of point and the current buffer in register r (point-to-register). 

C-x r j r
    Jump to the position and buffer saved in register r (jump-to-register).

C-x r s r
    Copy region into register r (copy-to-register). 

C-x r i r
    Insert text from register r (insert-register). 

M-x append-to-register <RET> r
    Append region to text in register r.  When register r contains text, you
    can use C-x r + (increment-register) to append to that register. Note that
    command C-x r + behaves differently if r contains a number. See Number
    Registers.

M-x prepend-to-register <RET> r
    Prepend region to text in register r.
